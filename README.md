# For Task 7 of the Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship - Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions
### Objective: Learn to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions.
### Tools: Any web browser (Chrome, Firefox).
### Deliverables: A list of suspicious extensions found and removed (if any).
### Steps Taken:
 * Opened the browser's extension/add-ons manager: (Specify which browser you used, e.g., "I opened Google Chrome's extension manager by navigating to chrome://extensions.").
 * Reviewed all installed extensions carefully: (Describe the process, e.g., "I systematically went through each installed extension.").
 * Checked permissions and reviews for each extension: (Explain what you looked for, e.g., "For each extension, I examined the permissions it requested, looking for overly broad access. I also checked user reviews and ratings to gauge their reputation.").
 * Identified any unused or suspicious extensions: (List any extensions you identified as suspicious or unnecessary. If none were found, state that. E.g., "I identified the following extensions as suspicious/unnecessary:
   * [Extension Name 1] - Reason for suspicion/removal (e.g., requested access to all websites, low reviews, unknown developer)
   * [Extension Name 2] - Reason for suspicion/removal (e.g., no longer used, suspicious activity noticed)
   * ...
     "
     OR
     "No suspicious or unnecessary extensions were found during my review of [Your Browser] extensions.").
 * Removed suspicious or unnecessary extensions: (If you removed any, confirm it. E.g., "I removed the identified suspicious/unnecessary extensions.").
 * Restarted browser and checked for performance improvements: (Mention if you noticed any changes. E.g., "After removing the extensions, I restarted [Your Browser] and observed [any performance improvements or no noticeable change].").
 * Researched how malicious extensions can harm users: (Briefly summarize your findings here. For example, "I researched that malicious extensions can steal personal data, inject ads, redirect web traffic, log keystrokes, and even install malware.").
 * Documented steps taken and extensions removed: (This README serves as the documentation).

### Removed Extensions (Example)

| Extension Name       | Reason for Removal                     |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| SaveFrom.net Helper  | Unfamiliar source, high data access    |
| PDF Converter Pro    | Suspicious permissions and poor reviews|

### Interview Questions and Answers:
Prepare answers to these questions for a potential interview:
 1) How can browser extensions pose security risks?
      *Browser extensions can pose security risks by requesting excessive permissions (e.g., access to all your Browse data), potentially logging keystrokes, injecting malicious code, redirecting users to phishing sites, or stealing sensitive information like cookies and passwords.
 2) What permissions should raise suspicion?
     * Permissions that should raise suspicion include "read and change all your data on the websites you visit," "access your physical location," "read your Browse history," or "manage your downloads" if they are not directly relevant to the extension's stated purpose.
 3) How to safely install browser extensions?
     * To safely install browser extensions, always download them from official stores (Chrome Web Store, Firefox Add-ons). Check the developer's reputation, read reviews, examine the permissions requested, and ensure the extension has a clear and relevant purpose.
 4) What is extension sandboxing?
     * Extension sandboxing is a security mechanism that isolates extensions from other parts of your browser and operating system. This limits the damage an malicious extension can do by restricting its access to sensitive resources and data.
5)Can extensions steal passwords?
     * Yes, extensions can steal passwords if they have permissions to read your Browse data, inject scripts into web pages, or log keystrokes. Malicious extensions can capture login credentials as you type them or read them directly from compromised web pages.
6)How to update extensions securely?
   * Extensions typically update automatically through the browser's update mechanism, which is generally secure. However, you should periodically review updated permissions, and ensure updates are coming from legitimate sources. Avoid installing updates from unofficial prompts.
 7) Difference between extensions and plugins?
     * Extensions primarily modify or enhance the functionality of the browser itself (e.g., ad blockers, password managers).
     * Plugins (like Flash or Java) were historically used to display specific types of web content, but their use has largely been deprecated due to security concerns and the rise of web standards like HTML5.
 8) How to report malicious extensions?
     * Malicious extensions can be reported through the official extension store where they were downloaded (e.g., "Report Abuse" link in the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons site).
